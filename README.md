### Yet Another Todos App

Created with [OLOO](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&%20object%20prototypes/ch6.md#delegation-theory) style JavaScript and a little help from [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and the [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) API. The purpose to making a somewhat complicated todo app in this fashion this was to "feel the pain" of not having a framework.

### Setup

Everything you need (jQuery) is imported from a CDN. Just open the `todos.html` file and you're off to the races.
